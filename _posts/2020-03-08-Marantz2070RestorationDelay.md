# Marantz 2070 Restoration Delay  
I'm still waiting on parts to arrive from Germany before I begin this project. They were scheduled to arrive
by last Friday, but they have just cleared customs today. It looks like it will be at least one more weekend before I can begin.  
The part I'm waiting on is the replacement faceplate. I suppose I could have peformed the re-capping in the interim, butI want to just do it all in one go.
